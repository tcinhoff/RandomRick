This program starts a random episode of Rick and Morty.
You have to add your Neftlix data in the Login.json file (email / password).
Execute the main in a console of your choice.
(python main.py)
Because the navigation in Netflix doesnÂ´t work as wanted you get a message with the season and episode and you have to navigate the last 3 steps by yourself.
Enjoy Rick and Morty!
